It’s ideological stance was to form pan hispanism and hemispheric integration. El Ateneo appealed to American manufacturers in order to advertise to the Spanish speaking community. According to Nicolás Kanellos’s A Brief History of Hispanic Periodicals in the United States, publications like El Ateneo “placed hispanic immigrant communities in the United States on the international cultural map” (64). It was a place that had a designated space just for essayists, fiction writers and poets all from Spanish America and the United States. El Ateneo informed the people and institutes of Spanish American countries of the United States educational, scientific and agricultural advances so that these countries could follow them in order to form a path of success. It is important to note though that it still remained connected to its cultural accomplishments of the Hispanic community.\_\_\L\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nWorks Cited\n\nKanellos, Nicolás, and Helvetia Martell.

    blurb: "## El Mundo Nuevo\n\nEl Mundo Nuevo/La América Ilustrada was a biweekly magazine published in New York between 1871-1875. It initially started in the offices of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Leslie on Pearl Street. The magazine included eye-catching illustrations, which the Leslie organization prioritized but worked to stay away for its tendency toward sensationalism. An excerpt from the reading states, “El Mundo Nuevo/La América Ilustrada turned into a marketable commodity for a designated segment of the middle-class readership”(187). The magazine had certain identities that it encouraged its readers to align themselves with one being “residents or citizens of the United States who took pride in their cultural Hispanism” or as “elite Spanish Americans” (187). The “midwife” of El Mundo Nuevo's birth was Enrique Piñeyro, who was the magazine editor. He was a Cuban refugee who came to the U.S at the beginning of the Ten Years’ War in 1868. Pineyro had great aspirations for the magazine, which he structured into a “illustrated encyclopedia” including things like “belletristic essays, serialized novels, descriptive and scientific engravings, poetry, and digested important international and local news” (188). Piñeyro’s initial editorial promise to the magazine was “an essentially artistic and literary publication, original and American”(188).\n\nThere is only 6 different libraries that has existing copies of El Mundo Nuevo. • New York Public Library System • Newberry Library (in Chicago) • Dallas Theological Seminary • University of Texas Libraries • The Claremont Colleges • University of California, NRLF\n\nPhoto credits: Newberry Library Google Earth,\_[https://earth.google.com/web/@40.71409601,-74.00241183,5.64091721a,399.90611393d,35y,11.63163453h,0t,0r/data=CjYSNBIgY2NjOGJhYWVhYjg5MTFlODg4N2U3MWQ2MDFiMTRkNzUiEHJ1bXNleV93aGVyZV8xMDE](https://earth.google.com/web/@40.71409601,-74.00241183,5.64091721a,399.90611393d,35y,11.63163453h,0t,0r/data=CjYSNBIgY2NjOGJhYWVhYjg5MTFlODg4N2U3MWQ2MDFiMTRkNzUiEHJ1bXNleV93aGVyZV8xMDE)\_Historical Maps Around the World: New York 1852,\_[https://earth.google.com/web/@40.71409601,-74.00241183,5.64091721a,399.90611393d,35y,11.63163453h,0t,0r/data=CjYSNBIgY2NjOGJhYWVhYjg5MTFlODg4N2U3MWQ2MDFiMTRkNzUiEHJ1bXNleV93aGVyZV8xMDE](https://earth.google.com/web/@40.71409601,-74.00241183,5.64091721a,399.90611393d,35y,11.63163453h,0t,0r/data=CjYSNBIgY2NjOGJhYWVhYjg5MTFlODg4N2U3MWQ2MDFiMTRkNzUiEHJ1bXNleV93aGVyZV8xMDE)\_OldNYC,\_[https://www.oldnyc.org/#718561f-a](https://www.oldnyc.org/)\n\nWork Cited: Silva Gruesz, Kirsten. “Brave Mundo Nuevo: The Marketing of Transnational Spanish Culture.” Ambassadors of Culture The Transamerican Origins of Latino Writing, Princeton University Press, 2002, pp.186-196.

    blurb: "## La América Ilustrada\n\nLa América Ilustrada, published from 1871 to 1875, was housed in 41 Park Row, Rooms 22, 23, and 30. La América Ilustrada is often talked about in conjunction with El Mundo Nuevo as the two newspapers merged. They had many of the same authors and editors like Colombian poet Rafael Pombo and Puerto Rican educator Eugenio Maria de Hostos, who aimed to educate and advocate for Latino communities (like Cubanindependence from Spain during the Ten Year’s war). In fact, “at the height of its influence, the paper helped direct U.S. policy toward Cuba during the Ten Years War by publicizing the ‘martyrdom’ of poet Juan Clemente Zenea, who had been ambushed and imprisoned while on his way from New York to Cuba on a diplomatic peace mission” (Gruesz 162). La América Ilustrada, along with El Mundo Nuevo, consisted of two main editors, Enrique Piñeyro and Juan de Armas. Piñeyro was a Cuban literate and activist who took part in the Antillean pro independence organization, the Junta Central Republicana de Cuba y Puerto Rico, and took over the editorship of La Revolucion de Cuba. Juan de Armas, born in 1842, was involved in other publications in the United States such as “La Aurora,” La America, and soon his own publication, El Ateneo. Other contributing writers to La America Ilustrada include Rafael Pumbo and Isabel Prieto. Rafael Pumbo was a successor and biweekly writer. Born in 1833 to an elite family, Pumbo grew up to be a Colombian poet, diplomat, and editor who resided in New York and Washington for two decades before returning to Colombia in 1872. Isabel Prieto started off as an anonymous writer under the name “I.A.P” where she would publish poems in response to the misogynistic writings published by the male dominated publication companies. She soon made herself known in a piece in El Mundo Nuevo and continued her publishings from then on. 41 Park Row was the site of an Old Brick Church called the \"Brick Presbyterian Church\" in the late 1700s, which John McComb Sr built. Once the church moved uptown, the New York Times co-founder Edward B. Wesley bought part of the building for their publication site. The building was reconstructed into an even bigger building that is now 13 stories tall. It is described as \"New York's loftiest and most beautiful building,\" according to the New York Times. Pace University has owned the building since 1951 till now. 41 Park Row was designated to be considered as a New York City landmark in 1999. 41 Park Row used to house the Pace University bookstore and gym in 2017 and 2019. The building is now converted into an art gallery, classrooms, and offices. Pace University has owned the building for over 70 years now. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\_\n\nWorks Cited Dunlap, David W. “150th Anniversary: 1851-2001; Six Buildings That Share One Story”. The New York Times.

    blurb: "## La Edad de Oro\n\nFounded in 1889 and edited by José Martí, La Edad de Oro, is a publication dedicated to educating and entertaining “los niño de América.” Meaning “The Golden Age”, La Edad de Oro provided poems, essays, and other written words to the children of America. The monthly magazine lasted four months, which translates to four issues. It was located at 77 William Street, though this location no longer exists as it was replaced by the headquarters of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. The first edition was published in July of 1889 and contains a dedication and farewell section as well as two poems, two stories, and three essays. Each issue contained poems, stories, and essays that displayed Martí’s idealism and the importance he placed on educating the youth. “The purpose of La Edad de Oro,” Martí wrote, “is for children in the Americas to know how people lived before, how we live today, in America, and in other lands as well” ([http://cubanthinkers.domains.uflib.ufl.edu/la-edad-de-oro-1889/](http://cubanthinkers.domains.uflib.ufl.edu/la-edad-de-oro-1889/)). Martí wanted to close the divide between different races and socioeconomic statuses by teaching compassion to children through this magazine. For example, there is a poem in the publication called “Los Zapaticos de Rosa” where two children of different socioeconomic status meet on a beach. One child is barefoot meanwhile the other wears little red shoes and it ends with the rich child giving her shoes to the other child. This poem showcases the divide between classes and encourages children to lessen the division by having compassion for those less fortunate. La Edad de Oro lasted only 4 issues due to conflicting views between Jose Martí and another editor, A. Dacosta Gomez. Gomez believed children should be taught to fear a single god, while Martí believed that gods were not based in reality and instead were the “poetry of imagination” (“La Edad De Oro”). in teaching children to fear God, Martí believed he would be lying to his readers, thus the end of La Edad de Oro came. Distributed in Cuba, U.S., Spain, and Venezuela, La Edad de Oro is still distributed and a part of many children’s curriculum to this day. The impact of this publication is great, and it deserves more recognition and coverage. Most information on the magazine exists in Spanish, making these grand ideas inaccessible to non-Spanish speakers. The first issue and volume is available in its entirety on the website, Gutenberg.com. Copies of the publication are also available at Fordham Library, Columbia Library, and the Public Library of Suffolk County. Some\_scholarly articles or chapters in books that have been written about La Edad de Oro are\_Hispania by Fernando G. Campoamor and Revista Hispánica Moderna by Herminio Almendros. These scholarly articles were written in Spanish in the 20th Century and mainly talk about Martí's vision for children literature based on translations. It's available to purchase on various websites listed as used and the price ranges from $7.99 to $19.99. However, making La Edad de Oro more accessible to non-Spanish speaking American children should be a priority in this field.\n\nWorks Cited: Picture:\_[https://images.app.goo.gl/62BCaqBhFAUSwGrU6](https://images.app.goo.gl/62BCaqBhFAUSwGrU6)\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19898/19898-h/19898-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19898/19898-h/19898-h.htm)\n\nCuba, Pearl of the Caribbean,\_[http://cubanthinkers.domains.uflib.ufl.edu/la-edad-de-oro-1889/](http://cubanthinkers.domains.uflib.ufl.edu/la-edad-de-oro-1889/).\n\nCampoamor, Fernando G. “La Edad de Oro de José Martí, Texto de Los Niños Cubanos.” Hispania, vol. 24, no. 2, 1941, pp. 178–79.

    blurb: "## Patria\n\nThe newspaper publication, Patria (Homeland) was originally created in the 1890's by Jose Martí during the last phase of the Cuban Revolution for independence.

The publication itself was written at a time where there was a quiet, yet influential movement going on within Latinx writing.\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nThe purpose of creating this publication began as an outlet for his activism, giving the Latinx community in New York a voice and revolutionize the idea of fighting for their own independence.

We found a JSTOR political article from the book Cuban Studies entitled “José Martí and the Politics of Journalism” by Eileen McGovern, where she discusses the monumental impact Martí’s writing had at the time. McGovern includes the purpose behind the newspaper by quoting Martí directly from the first publication. Marti writes that the purpose of the publication is, “To come together and to love, and to live in the passion of the truth, this newspaper is born” (McGovern 124). According to Martí, “truth” had been his passion and weapon to which he believed would free Cuba. Patria exhibits Martí’s passion and truth in fighting for independence of the Latinx community.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nKanellos, Nicolás, and Helvetia Martell.

    blurb: "## La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York\n\nLa Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York (1882-?) was located at 124 Chamber Street. La Revista specialized in short novels, poetry, fashion commentary, and illustrations. This broad specialization thoroughly informed readers in a variety of subjects aside from day-to-day news. This publication company served as a platform for “renowned living writers of the Hispanic world (Kanellos 67). La Revista highlighted the work of renowned authors such as Juan Valera and Rubén Darío, and it famously served as the first newspaper company to publish José Martí’s Nuestra America. The company served an audience of middle and upper class Hispanics from a wide range of locations, even attracting readers in the Caribbean, Central, South America, and the Phillippines. La Revista Ilustrada “saw itself as thoroughly modern and progressive and identified highly with American technology, industrial, and scientific advancement” (Kanellos 68). According to author, Celso Rodriguez in “The Hispanic American Historical Review,” “…Although the emphasis of the magazine was to promote Spanish values, it offered a diversity of\_ intellectual interests, including topics dealing with the United States and Europe” (Rodríguez 763). With its progressive attitude and modern identity, La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York promoted pan-Hispanic unity in resisting American interventionism and modern-day colonialism.\n\nWork Cited: Bolet Peraza, N. “La Revista Ilustrada De Nueva York.” 1882. de Beer, Gabriella. “IN PURSUIT OF ‘LA REVISTA ILUSTRADA,’ A 19th CENTURY NEW YORK MAGAZINE.” Bilingual Review / La Revista Bilingüe, vol. 4, 1977, pp. 145–146.
