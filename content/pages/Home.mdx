    subtitle: >-
      New York City has long served as a major publishing center in the history
      of Latin American and Latinx literature. At the end of the nineteenth
      century, the city’s Spanish-language publishing community was centered in
      the very neighborhood that surrounds Pace University.

            To recover the history of New York City's nineteenth-century Latina/o
            press, students at Pace University have been locating the forgotten
            sites of the publications that once resided there and beginning to
            re-imagine the ways in which writers and editors of the city's
            Spanish- and English-languages publishing communities might have
            interacted with each other.
